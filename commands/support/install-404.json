    "Problem 1: One possibility is that you've installed NamelessMC within a subdirectory, you only can do this on v2. A requirement for the package to function is that the files are installed directly into your root directory, or you use a subdomain to point to the subdirectory.\n\n",
    "Problem 2: Ensure a file named \".htaccess\" exists in your web server's root directory containing [these rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/master/.htaccess).\n\n",
    "Problem 3: If this is not the case, you will need to modify your server configuration to enable the use of .htaccess files and also Apache's mod_rewrite module.\n\n",
    "Usually this occurs if you are running Apache on Ubuntu/Debian, in which case the following should resolve your issue:\n",
    "1. Edit **/etc/apache2/apache2.conf** (or whichever conf file corresponds to your Nameless installation)\n",
    "2. Find ``<Directory /var/www/html>`` and change the ``AllowOverride`` below it as shown below:\n",
